# object_detection

## Introduction

To follow the detected object with the drone camera. In the project, we performed the tracking process by converting the position values of the detected object into the coordinate system using the YOLOv3 algorithm and the MOSSE tracking algorithm.

## Dependencies
Python3, numpy, opencv, dronekit

## Getting started

1. You need to install dronekit library using pip:

   ```
   pip install dronekit
   ```

2. You can install the dronekit-sitl library on all platforms using pip:

   ```
   pip install dronekit-sitl -UI
   ```

3. If you can see drone tracking operations on the map in Mission Planner, you can install the Mission Planner program for this:

4. you need install opencv library using pip:

   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

5. you need install numpy library using pip:

   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```
